### 改进 issues

有一些 issues 在创建的时候带有一些令人误导的信息，不可复现，或者根本就是不合理的。来帮忙让这些问题变得更好解决。解决 issues 需要话费大量的本可以修复 bugs 或者增加功能的时间。

### 提交 issues

- The issue tracker is for issues. Use our [chat](https://gitter.im/sindresorhus/ava) or [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/ava) for support.
- Search the issue tracker before opening an issue.
- Ensure you're using the latest version of AVA.
- Use a clear and descriptive title.
- Include as much information as possible: Steps to reproduce the issue, error message, Node.js version, operating system, etc.
- The more time you put into an issue, the more we will.
- [The best issue report is a failing test proving it.](https://twitter.com/sindresorhus/status/579306280495357953)

### Submitting a pull request

- Non-trivial changes are often best discussed in an issue first, to prevent you from doing unnecessary work.
- For ambitious tasks, you should try to get your work in front of the community for feedback as soon as possible. Open a pull request as soon as you have done the minimum needed to demonstrate your idea. At this early stage, don't worry about making things perfect, or 100% complete. Add a [WIP] prefix to the title, and describe what you still need to do. This lets reviewers know not to nit-pick small details or point out improvements you already know you need to make. 
- New features should be accompanied with tests and documentation.
- Don't include unrelated changes.
- Lint and test before submitting the pull request by running `$ npm test`.
- Make the pull request from a [topic branch](https://github.com/dchelimsky/rspec/wiki/Topic-Branches), not master.
- Use a clear and descriptive title for the pull request and commits.
- Write a convincing description of why we should land your pull request. It's your job to convince us. Answer "why" it's needed and provide use-cases.
- You might be asked to do changes to your pull request. There's never a need to open another pull request. [Just update the existing one.](https://github.com/RichardLitt/docs/blob/master/amending-a-commit-guide.md)
